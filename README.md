### The Problem Statement:
To develop an application that uses face recognition system to detect the facial expressions of a person using the inbuilt camera.
Based on the expressions system will assign mood to the user and start playing songs depending upon the mood from the playlist that will be created and filled by the user  itself.
### Reason For Selecting This Topic:
Music has become the part of our lives. Music players should do far more things than just playing songs and allowing users to create playlists. A music player should be intelligent and act according to user’s preferences. A music player should help users organize and play the songs automatically without putting much eﬀort into selection and re-organization of songs. The Expression-Based Music Player provides a better platform to all the music listeners, and ensures automation of song selection and periodic updating of play-lists. This helps users organize and play songs based on their moods.
### Objectives:
It is the application that helps the user to automatically play the song based on the emotions of the user. It recognizes the facial expressions of the user and plays the songs according to their emotion. The emotions are recognized using python. .The android device captures the image of the user, It then extract the facial features of the user from the captured image. 
According to the emotion, the music will be played from the predefined directories and playlists.
### Feasibility Study:
The main functionality of this application is to give users more features to automate the selection and organization of the songs based on user preferences. Initially, the user saves each song to different playlists and gives details about the song, like category and interest. Songs are listed and categorized based on user’s interest. The Expression Based Music Player givens user’s feedback about their usage
### Future Scope:
The main functionality of this application is to give users more features to automate the selection and organization of the songs based on user preferences. Initially, the user saves each song to different playlists and gives details about the song, like category and interest. Songs are listed and categorized based on user’s interest. The Expression Based Music Player givens user’s feedback about their usage
1. Capturing expressions using camera.
2. Adding Songs
3. Removing Songs
4. Updating Songs
5. Making Personalized Playlists
### Methodology
This music player includes the functioning of an inbuilt camera that captures the image of the user and then this image is sent for the image processing that uses python at the backend .After the image processing is done, it will send back and with the help of API it will assign the particular type of mood of the user .The mood can be a smiling face i.e. joyful face secondly it can be depressed and the last one will be angry face. There are 4  directories that are made with the help of SQLite that are filled by the user, that consist of the selected songs based on different moods of the user i.e. joyous, depressed, angry and the neutral that consists of random songs . User can add a song, remove songs or can update songs . When it had assigned a particular mood to the user it will pick a random song from the library and start playing.
When the application unable to detect any type pf the above mentioned expression then it will give message as not defined expression and will play the song from the fourth library that consist of randomly shuffled songs.
